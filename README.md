# Some of my asset files (multi-use)

## .Code Folder

This folder has my VSCode's json configuration file

## .gitmessage File

Oh, this is a good one. This file has a default git commit message, where I am trying to combine and perfect the commit message art.

For it to work, clone the repo into your home folder - or copy the file - and do the following configuration:
```git
  git config --global commit.template PATH_TO_FILE/.gitmessage
```

## .vimrc File

This file has some vim configuration of my own (very nice stuff btw), and it is based on [this](https://gitlab.com/lappis-unb/tools/vim/lappis_vimrc) git repo's vim configuration.

To apply my changes, follow the instruction of that repo and then override their .vimrc with mine.

## .bashrc_custom

Some configs for the bash layout were made and I put in there. Don't mind that file, it is silly stuff.

Or do. Your choice.

## .sh Files

These are some scripts to quick-install some things. Yes, I know docker exists. It was more of a practice kind of stuff that I made, could be useful though..
